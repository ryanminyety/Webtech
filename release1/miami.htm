       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston">Miami</a> Miami Beach is a coastal resort city in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It was incorporated on March 26, 1915.[7] The municipality is located on natural and man-made barrier islands between the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay, the latter of which separates the Beach from the mainland city of Miami. The neighborhood of South Beach, comprising the southernmost 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2) of Miami Beach, along with downtown Miami and the Port of Miami, collectively form the commercial center of South Florida.[8] Miami Beach's estimated population is 88,885 according to the most recent United States census estimates. Miami Beach is the 26th largest city in Florida based on official 2019 estimates from the US Census Bureau.[9] It has been one of America's pre-eminent beach resorts since the early 20th century.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida">Miami Beach</a> While the Atlantic Ocean and South Beach may get all the attention, Miami’s geography is distinct in its relationship to Biscayne Bay. An intracoastal waterway along the western shores of Miami Beach, Biscayne Bay opens up into a more expansive body of water south of Key Biscayne where it becomes Biscayne National Park spanning 172,000 acres with a shoreline of mangrove preserves. With so many miles of bayside coastline, there are ample opportunities to enjoy a great meal with a view at one of Miami’s top bayside restaurants.

It’s harder than you think to find the best Miami Beach restaurants outside of South Beach. It’s an area of the Beach that often gets glossed over in conversations about food and drink. Many mainland-bound Miamians still protest the drive over the bridge too. But that’s an antiquated way of thinking and if you still haven’t dove mouth-first into Mid Beach and North Beach, it’s your loss. This chunk of land is home to some of the best bars in Miami and some of the best restaurants in Miami too. And the good news is we’ve already done the hard part of finding the best spots. Now all you have to do is go forth and eat.

  1. Pubbelly Sushi
<p>
    An OG on South Beach, Pubbelly Sushi is best known for its rolls like its Instagram famous butter krab roll made with goma soy paper, kanikama, ponzu, with warm clarified butter for dipping. Start out with the tuna pizza, and ease into the rolls and robata offerings. But be careful, while portions are a decent and meant for sharing, it’s easy to get overly excited and want them all.

  Lucali<p>
    Pizza is the ultimate comfort food, and one of Miami’s best pizzerias Lucali, offers up some of the best in the city.

  Juvia<p>
    A contemporary restaurant buzzing atop the 1111 Lincoln Road mixed-use building and parking garage, Juvia is a welcome breather from one of Miami’s most popular tourist destinations. Diners take a separate elevator up to a terrace for French, Japanese, and Peruvian plates, along with specialty cocktails and South Beach sights.</p>
</p>
4. Bodega Taqueria y Tequila
<p>
Tacos aren’t just for Tuesdays at Bodega. This menu boasts nine kinds of tacos and a handful of different types of burritos. Traditionalists will enjoy the al pastor with roasted pork, charred pineapple, red onion, cilantro, and salsa rosada, while those looking for something with a little different will love the camaron BLT with grilled shrimp, bacon, cabbage, and tomato drizzled with a chipotle cotija dressing. Vegans have no fear — there’s a vegan “pollo” taco on the menu as well.
