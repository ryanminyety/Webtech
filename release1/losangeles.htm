       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston">Boston</a> is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States and 21st most populous city in the United States. The city proper covers 48.4 square miles with an estimated population of 692,600 in 2019, also making it the most populous city in New England.
<hr></hr>
Boston is sometimes called a "city of neighborhoods" because of the profusion of diverse subsections; the city government's Office of Neighborhood Services has officially designated 23 neighborhoods. More than two-thirds of inner Boston's modern land area did not exist when the city was founded. Instead, it was created via the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries,[68] with earth from leveling or lowering Boston's three original hills (the "Trimountain", after which Tremont Street is named) and with gravel brought by train from Needham to fill the Back Bay.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saman%C3%A1_Province">Samana</a> To everything there is a season—especially in dining. Ingredients shift to reflect what’s fresh. Menus change with the weather. (Goodbye, summer salads. Hello, soups and stews!) And when it comes to our annual list of the 50 top restaurants in Boston, we see a similar evolution: Some star chefs who once helped define the city’s dining scene are no longer, or only sparingly, represented. (Wherefore art thou, Michael Schlow?) Meanwhile, a new generation of culinary innovators—those who cut their teeth working under the old guard—are finally coming into their own.
<br></br>
        But don’t get sentimental; this is a great time for local diners, as Boston’s top restaurants embrace the future with the same passion once reserved for celebrating the city’s history. Our number one pick, for instance, places a fine-dining restaurant, where one might expect white tablecloths, alongside a casual brewery; the list rounds out with a contemporary take on traditional communal feasts. And in between? Every spot reflects a unique point of view—a perspective on food that is all its own. Diners want that. We demand it. In 2019, cooking technically good food is no longer enough.

  Tasting Counter<p>
  In 2019, fine dining flourishes, rule-free, wherever it finds itself. Exhibit A: chef Peter Ungár’s ticketed tasting-menu experience inside the same Somerville warehouse as a hipster-packed brewery. And it is an experience—theater, really—to sit at the 20-seat counter, lined with suit jackets and T-shirts alike, and watch the tiny army on the other side tweeze together stunning plates such as octopus with charred strawberry and local beach-rose vinegar. Away from sky-high Boston rents, Ungár has room to experiment—and reveal what unencumbered talent tastes like. Somerville, tastingcounter.com.

  Asta<p>
  At Asta, chef Alex Crabb also indulges our current obsession with tasting menus—while tossing out some irreverent left turns to keep us on our toes. Here, the procession of plates follows an unexpected, lilting melody: saffron-flecked mussels in salt-cod foam here, a crisp BLT there. The casual vibe, meanwhile, belies the high-end technique Crabb honed at the late L’Espalier—and now shares with guests in his own dining room. Back Bay, astaboston.com.

  Uni<p>
  Uni evades easy descriptions. Yes, it’s a “sashimi bar,” but that hardly does justice to chef Tony Messina’s jewel-like raw presentations, such as knifejaw with blueberry kombucha. “Japanese-inspired small plates”? Sure—though Wagyu dumplings with cheddar-dashi broth, a heckuva play on a steak-and-cheese, probably weren’t what you were expecting. But that’s the beauty of this modern izakaya: It must be experienced to be understood, and even then, more surprises await each return. Back Bay, uni-boston.com.</p>
