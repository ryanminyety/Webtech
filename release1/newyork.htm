       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston">New York</a> New York City (NYC), often called simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[11] Located at the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass.[12] With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce,[13] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[14] New York is an important center for international diplomacy.
<hr></hr>
The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially "the Met",[a] is the largest art museum in the United States. With 6,479,548 visitors to its three locations in 2019, it was the fourth most visited art museum in the world.[10] Its permanent collection contains over 2 million works,[11] divided among 17 curatorial departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park in Manhattan's Upper East Side, is by area one of the world's largest art galleries. A much smaller second location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of art, architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe. On March 18, 2016, the museum opened the Met Breuer museum along Madison Avenue on the Upper East Side; it extends the museum's modern and contemporary art program.
<br></br>
The permanent collection consists of works of art from classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures from nearly all the European masters, and an extensive collection of American and modern art. The Met maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art. The museum is home to encyclopedic collections of musical instruments, costumes, and accessories, as well as antique weapons and armor from around the world. Several notable interiors, ranging from 1st-century Rome through modern American design, are installed in its galleries.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saman%C3%A1_Province">Boston</a> To everything there is a season—especially in dining. Ingredients shift to reflect what’s fresh. Menus change with the weather. (Goodbye, summer salads. Hello, soups and stews!) And when it comes to our annual list of the 50 top restaurants in Boston, we see a similar evolution: Some star chefs who once helped define the city’s dining scene are no longer, or only sparingly, represented. (Wherefore art thou, Michael Schlow?) Meanwhile, a new generation of culinary innovators—those who cut their teeth working under the old guard—are finally coming into their own.
<br></br>
        But don’t get sentimental; this is a great time for local diners, as Boston’s top restaurants embrace the future with the same passion once reserved for celebrating the city’s history. Our number one pick, for instance, places a fine-dining restaurant, where one might expect white tablecloths, alongside a casual brewery; the list rounds out with a contemporary take on traditional communal feasts. And in between? Every spot reflects a unique point of view—a perspective on food that is all its own. Diners want that. We demand it. In 2019, cooking technically good food is no longer enough.

  1. Adda
  Restaurants Indian Long Island City <p>
  
  
    What is it? The kitchen at Adda stays true to its roots without imparting gimmicky modern touches on Indian dishes. Whether you order butter chicken or a kale pakoda, there’s no holding back on flavors—the heat of peppers and warmth of cumin are just examples—that make you crave even more.
    <br></br>
    Why we love it? For a convivial dining experience where the food is as exciting as the vibe. The menu feels exciting each time we've visited with a nice balance between creativity and tradition.
    
    Time Out tip: The restaurant is barely the size of shoebox-sized New York apartment, so plan accordingly.<br></br></p>
   2. Crown Shy
Restaurants American Financial District<p>

What is it? Inside (and outside) the highly sought-after Art Deco residential building, 70 Pine Street, resides the first collaboration between James Kent, longtime chef de cuisine at Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park and executive chef at NoMad, alongside Jeff Katz, managing partner of Del Posto. 
<br></br>
Why we love it? Here, elevated meals are crafted by New York’s fine dining elite. You can ball out like a banker without breaking your piggy bank.
  </p>
  
    3. Mokyo
    Restaurants East Village
    <p>
    What is it? The new restaurant from the team behind the East Village favorite Thursday Kitchen is just as intriguing (save room for a Pop Rock dessert) as its original outpost. Here, tapas are influenced by chef Kyungmin Kay Hyun’s travels to Spain and South America as well as her Korean heritage. 
    <br><br>
    Why we love it? There's a twist on every dish that keeps us on our toes. The portions are also perfect for sharing, and the prices are reasonable enough that you'll want to order (and share) the entire menu.
